# Hello World

My name is Othmane, and I am a full-stack developer. I have a passion for creating web applications that provide excellent user experiences. 
With expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy working on all aspects of web development projects.

## Where I Work and Study
I work remotely for Pulsation Studio, a web agency specializing in creating innovative and tailored web solutions for clients.

In addition to my professional work, I am currently pursuing a master's degree at OpenClassrooms. 
This program helps me deepen my knowledge and expertise in the field of software development, while also providing the flexibility needed to balance my studies with my professional commitments. 
The master's program at OpenClassrooms is rigorous and comprehensive, covering advanced topics such as project and team management, as well as software development, which are essential for remaining competitive in the ever-evolving tech industry.
